### PROFFY PROJECT!

##### Developed during Next-Level-Week-Two from [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).

*"NLW is an event with a lot of code, challenges, networking and a single objective: to take you to the next level. Programming is a practical discipline. That is, to master a technology it is not enough to just know the theory or read the documentation: you need to get your hands on the code."*

The purpose of this NLW was to build an application with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL. The **Proffy** application consists of a landing page where the user can choose between searching for a teacher to study or include your name as a teacher to give classes. If the 'study' section is chosen it shows a filter page, so the user can select a subject, a day, and select a range of hours to search for a teacher. The 'give classes' page has a form to be fulfilled by the teacher with his/her info.

NLW2 took place in the first week of August 2020. I developed the project in parallel to my Trybe course in full-stack software development.

The project is configured to run on a local server (port 5500), with the command `npm run dev`.
